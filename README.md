# X3CSS
X3 is a new CSS framework written in... Java? Well, kind of.
Java is used as a compiler system, to write the actual file.
It's basically just a ton of for loops, and writer.append("Text\n").
Only clone this if you want to modify the _**source code.**_
Compiled CSS is in the Releases tab.

## Compiler
The compiler is written in Java and is pretty much just a giant
file writer. It simply writes the CSS to a file, and saves it.
The save directory is {user directory}/X3Dist/x3-v{version}.css.

## Changes
Make sure to make an issue or a pull request if you see an error
while compiling, or any class like this:
```
.text-comp-error-c1\:IncorrectColorBase-300 {
    color: rgb(0,0,0);
}
```
Thanks!
